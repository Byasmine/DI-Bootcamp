    "## Netflix and Data Analysis\n",
    "In this case study, Netflix used data analysis to decide whether to produce the original series “House of Cards.” The company analyzed detailed user behavior data, including viewing history, preferred actors, popular genres, and audience retention statistics. Using machine learning and predictive analysis, Netflix identified a strong pattern: users who liked political dramas also watched movies by Kevin Spacey and shows directed by David Fincher. Based on this insight, Netflix approved the production of “House of Cards.” The series became a major success and helped grow Netflix’s subscriber base. This example shows how data analysis can guide business decisions, reduce risk, and predict what audiences want. Without data analysis, Netflix would have relied on intuition alone, making the decision far more risky."
